// To fix the error, you need to download the actual Stockfish.js WASM files:
// 1. Go to: https://github.com/lichess-org/stockfish.wasm/releases
// 2. Download the latest stockfish.js and stockfish.wasm files
// 3. Place them in your public folder

// For now, this placeholder will prevent the "Unexpected token '<'" error
// by providing a valid JavaScript file instead of a 404 HTML response
